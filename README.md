## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Any tools you like can be used to complete the challenge. 

## Objectives

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Both a mobile and a desktop version of the design can be found. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing helpful informations, such as color palette and fonts.

## Project deployment

The live version of the website can be found at 

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building as I did!** ðŸš€
